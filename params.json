{"body":"### Channels\r\n\r\n[Download Channels](http://github.com/atduskgreg/Channels/downloads)\r\n\r\nChannels is a Processing library that lets you extract the red, green, blue, brightness, hue, or saturation channels from a PImage. It works similarly to Processing's built-in [red()](http://processing.org/reference/red_.html), [green()](http://processing.org/reference/green_.html), [blue()](http://processing.org/reference/bluee_.html), [brightness()](http://processing.org/reference/brightness_.html), [hue()](http://processing.org/reference/hue_.html), and [saturation()](http://processing.org/reference/saturation_.html) functions, but instead of applying to individual pixels, Channels' equivalent functions apply to the entire image.","google":"","name":"Channels","tagline":"Processing library that lets you pull out RGB, brightness, hue, and saturation channels from a PImage","note":"Don't delete this file!
